            <!--The first paragraph is about past field trips-->
            <p>I was given the opportunity to attend a google talk with Kari Byron in a recent field trip. During this field trip I was able to meet Kari Byron and the producer, Jenny Brucos, of her new show Crash Test World. We were able to learn about the premise and the production of the show. We were given an insight on what Kari and Jenny learned while making the show. This was a memorable experience as we were given the opportunity to visit the google campus and learn about the experiences on Crash Test World. Kari and Jenny taught us about pursuing ideas and taking on different experiences to our advantage. </p>
