        <!-- this first paragraph is an introduction of myself and my goals in this course-->
          I am currently a freshman at Dublin High School. I aspire to become an engineer and work in the engineering field, but am unsure of what part of the field I want to work in. Therefore, I have chosen to take a computer science principles course in order to receive a broader idea of what I want to do in the future. My goal is to become more familiar with coding and computer science by the end of the course. I have since been accepted into the engineering academy which will introduce me to more opportunities to learn about engineering. 
        <!-- this second paragraph is qualities of myself and how they apply to the engineering field-->
         <br>
         <br>
         I am determined and ambitious, which means I work hard and try to challenge myself by shooting higher. This is important in the engineering field because many things are not straightforward, but need critical thinking and problem solving to understand. As shown through countless projects and assignments, I try my best to present my best work. 
         <br>

        <!-- this last paragraph is about my achievements and to thank the user for reading the about me page-->
        While I have not been in high school very long, I have tried to join many school clubs and is trying to find an engineering club that I can partake in. I also participated in competition debate, in which I had the opportunity to compete for the Norcal cup, which my team of three placed fifth overall team in the tournament. Continuing into freshman year, my partner and I placed third overall at SCU tourney and broke to triple-octos at Stanford Tourney. Through this, I am able to show my ability to work and communicate with others and contribute my own part to reach a certain goal. I am often a leader in a project, but also work well with other people, being cooperative and open to new ideas. Thank you for reading my “about me” page and please enjoy the rest of my website.
