          <p><strong>Project:</strong> Scratch Project</p>
          <p><strong>Course:</strong> CSP (Computer Science Principles)</p>
          <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Approximately two weeks (September 2019)</p>
          <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To code a game or interactive story using the Scratch platform</p>
          <p><strong>Type of Project:</strong> Pair-programming</p>
          <p>The goal of this project was to get an introduction to coding using Scratch, a drag-and-drop coding platform. We were instructed to pair program an interactive story or game that was then previewed by the class during a gallery. My partner and I chose to create a interactive-story about a dinosaur where the user would be able to choose what to feed the dinosaur. My partner and I ran into a problem to see how we could both efficiently work on the code as the platform did not allow two people to be working on the same project at once. Therefore, we were able to problem solve and work around the problem by assigning each partner a different role and digitally communicating to put the code together. I was in charge of the backbone code which would be used throughout the project, while my partner was in charge of creating background, dialogue, and characters. Through this project we were able to learn the basics of coding.</p>

          <p><strong>Project:</strong> MIT App Inventor Project</p>
          <p><strong>Course:</strong> CSP (Computer Science Principles)</p>
          <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Approximately three weeks (November 2019)</p>
          <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To code a game instructed by a tutorial provided by MIT using the MIT App Inventor platform. </p>
          <p><strong>Type of Project:</strong> Pair-programming</p>
          <p>The goal of this project was to transition between drag-and-drop coding into typing code into the platform. We were given tutorials to choose from and my partner and I chose to code a mini golf game that allowed the user to flick the ball into a hole while avoiding an obstacle. We found it challenging to improve the game after finishing the tutorial, however, we were able to add a water hazard which would reset the ball at the tee without resetting the score, making it a penalty. We learned how to work around coding problems and how it was extremely important to test as you code instead of just at the end.</p>

          <p><strong>Project:</strong> Photo Manipulation Project</p>
          <p><strong>Course:</strong> CSP (Computer Science Principles)</p>
          <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Approximately 2 weeks (March 2020)</p>
          <p><strong>Objective:</strong>Use Python to code an algorithm to custom frames on a set of family photos</p>
          <p><strong>Type of Project:</strong> Pair-programming</p>
          <p>In this project we were instructed to create an algorthm that could frame a set of four family images. We were to create a themed set of frames with a common symbol using the language python. My partner and I split the work while I mainly focussed on the code and she focussed on the presentation. Our biggest challenge in this project was finishing the algorithm. The code was much harder compared to previous projects and it took a while to write code that worked correctly.</p>
